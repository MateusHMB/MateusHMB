## About
Technical researcher and Computer Science student with a dedicated focus on the security lifecycle of decentralized applications. My work centers on the identification of smart contract vulnerabilities, understanding EVM internals, and exploring automated vulnerability detection. I maintain a research-driven mindset, prioritizing the deep understanding of exploit vectors over superficial fixes, with the long-term goal of contributing to the ecosystem as a Smart Contract Auditor and Security Researcher.

## Research
Currently involved in undergraduate research projects at **UFV (Universidade Federal de Viçosa)** focused on the intersection of Software Engineering and Blockchain Security. Key areas of investigation include:

* **Security Analysis of Smart Contracts:** Systematic review of logical and language-specific vulnerabilities, including access control, arithmetic issues, and state-machine bugs.
* **Detection Methodologies:** Comparative analysis of manual auditing versus automated tools in the identification of critical exploits.
* **Advanced Approaches:** Exploration of AI-assisted vulnerability scanning and the application of formal methods to smart contract verification.

## Technical Skills


### Tools & Programming
* **Languages:** Solidity, Python, C, C++, Verilog.
* **Infrastructure:** Linux (Debian/WSL), Git, Makefile.

## Security Projects


### Smart Contract Audit Practice
* Public reports on mock audits conducted on decentralized protocols, focusing on business logic flaws and edge-case manipulation.


## Learning Goals
* **Formal Verification:** Mastering mathematical proof of contract correctness using formal methods.
* **Exploit Development:** Deep-dive into complex DeFi hacks and flash loan attack vectors.
* **Security Research:** Contributing to the community through the documentation of novel vulnerability patterns and EIP analysis.
